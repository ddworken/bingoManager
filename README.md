bingoManager
============

A Java program to manage Bingo games. 

Current status: Only supports single boards for now, but support for additional boards at once is trivial to add via an ArrayList. Currently requires user to input data about both boards and what numbers are called. Eventually I hope to implement OCR software for recognizing the bingo board and speech recognition for the numbers being called.
